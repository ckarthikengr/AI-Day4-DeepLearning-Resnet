Flower classification using Pytorch and ResNet

Observations
Inorder to avoid overfitting and under fitting , we much 
        1) Choose correct neutral network based on the dataset, When i tried flower classification with simple neural network. It was overfitting- Model accuracy was 90% for trained data set for test data set it was only 30%
        2) Perform fine-tuning based on iteration and experience
            Example Learning rate, Epoch cycle etc

Still exploring different options, I will try to update here.
